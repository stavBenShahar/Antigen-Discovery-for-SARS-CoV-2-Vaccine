# Antigen-Discovery-for-SARS-CoV-2-Vaccine
This task involves training a deep neural network to identify peptide antigens for SARS-CoV-2. Using a dataset of peptides, you'll develop and evaluate an MLP model to detect potential antigens, addressing class imbalance and optimizing the network. Finally, apply the model to the Spike protein to find the top 3 detectable peptides.
